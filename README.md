S3 Stream Cat
=============

S3 Stream Cat powers you to instantly check the content of S3 file.
Especially it supports streaming and printing data from compressed files.

Compression Format Supported
============================

* Gzip

* BZIP

You might find it most useful when you don't actually want to download the file 
however want to check the sample data, or to grep for few records matching 
certain search. 
Typical usage often looks like this::

    s3streamcat s3://bucketname/dir/file_path
    s3streamcat s3://bucketname/dir/file_path | more
    s3streamcat s3://bucketname/dir/file_path | grep something

To try different encoding in case utf-8 is unable to decode your stream::
    s3streamcat -e latin-1 s3://bucketname/dir/file_path.gz

To tune number of bytes to be fetched at a time::
    s3streamcat -b 1024 s3://bucketname/dir/file_path.gz
